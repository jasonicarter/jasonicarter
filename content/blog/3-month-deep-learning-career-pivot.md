A self-study guide to becoming a deep learning non-expert
* * *

Like so many others, I’ve become fascinated by machine / deep learning over the past couple of years.

Unlike so many others, I’ve left my previous job to attempt to turn my hobby interest into a career and given myself a 3 month timeline to learn all I can about DL and test the waters of my potential future career.

Google “deep learning study path” and you’ll find a long list of suggested approaches, courses, math books, projects, etc for one to do in order to become an “expert” in machine learning. But what I really need is a schedule.

> Left to my own devices, I would read sci-fi novels, binge watch Netflix and generally accomplish nothing every day.

There are indeed, plenty of great online learning resources out there:

*   [Becoming a Data Scientist](https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/)
*   [The Most Comprehensive Data Science Learning Path (for 2017)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/the-most-comprehensive-data-science-learning-plan-for-2017)
*   [Udacity-Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730)
*   [Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers)
*   [The Machine Learning Mastery Method](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-mastery-method/)

But what I’m referring to is a more “real” schedule, not a long list of links, or a yearly plan but a monthly timeline focused on providing practical experience, learning and **implementing** (not researching) deep learning.

Ultimately my main goal is to answer the question:

> Do I really need to become an expert in Deep Learning in order to pivot my career into the field of Deep Learning?

## Perquisite

Like everything else, you have to start somewhere and I’m starting with a Software Engineering degree, jack-of-all-trades in a number on languages, hands-on experience building a [Raspberry Pi Hadoop Cluster](https://medium.com/@jasonicarter/how-to-hadoop-at-home-with-raspberry-pi-part-1-3b71f1b8ac4e), completed [Udacity’s Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) and recently worked as a Technical Product Owner at a professional services startup company.

I don’t believe you need my experience to follow my schedule, in fact, I’m going to go on the limb and say you only need 1 year of coding experience — if [Fast.ai MOOC](http://course.fast.ai/) can make the claim, so can I.

No Masters degree. No PhD. Only 3 months and 13 steps to you new career.

## Month 1

### Deep Learning: Part 1

There are plenty courses to choose from but after finding [Fast.ai](https://fast.ai) and learning about their top-down [teaching philosophy](http://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/), I was convinced to give it a try. [Jeremy Howard](https://medium.com/u/34ab754f8c5e) and [Rachel Thomas](https://medium.com/u/ee56d0bac1b7) (co-founders of Fast.ai) also believe in the democratization and diversity of deep learning which is always a big plus in my books.

The course outline for part 1 covers: Image classification with Theano, CNNs, CNN architecture, NLP & RNNs, Python 2.7 and more

> [_Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 1_](http://course.fast.ai/)

### Build Your Own Deep Learning Machine

Not only will it be cheaper in the long term (compared to AWS) but also, in the short term it’ll boost your day-to-day productivity.

Th idea here is to build a reasonably priced DL machine. Install all the required software yourself and learn a little more than your average ML developer.

### Become a Kaggler

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is to deep learning engineers as Github is to software engineers. Even if you never enter a competition (which you should!), Kaggle is a great source of knowledge. Visit the forums, datasets, scripts, etc.

The Fast.ai deep learning course gets you started with Kaggle from lesson 1.

> [_Kaggle_](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Month 2

### Start Blogging

Blogging about what you know, or even what you think you know, is a good way to get your thoughts organized, reviewed by others and improved along the way. And as a bonus, recruiters and employers read them too.

> [_Medium_](https://medium.com)

> [_Github Pages_](https://pages.github.com/)

### Attend Meetups

The idea here is to spend some time with the the dl/ml community. This could be a great source of knowledge and networking. Plus if you’re like me, full-time studying, it will also help get you out of the house and interacting with other human beings in person!

> [_Meetup.com_](https://www.meetup.com/)

> [_Eventbrite.ca_](https://www.eventbrite.ca/)

### Deep Learning: Part 2

Part 2 of the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course is currently in-progress (as of April ‘17). But by the time I finish part 1, part 2 should be online. No doubt it’ll involve more Kaggle and side projects.

The course outline for part 2 covers: Tensorflow, RNNs, Python 3, computer vision, NLP, production-izing models, and more

> [_Practical Deep Learning For Coders, Part 2_](http://course.fast.ai/)

### Personal Project

Kaggle is a great place to learn and practice your skills and it’s an ongoing effort but having a personal pet project is a great way to show off your particular interest but also to experiment a bit.

For me, it’s an example of taking deep learning and making it into an actual working product — which is where my interest is (and not the research side of things).

> _Mine will probably be computer vision related_

* * *

## Month 3

### Attend Meetups + Blogging

Keep at it.

### Deep Learning Part 2 + Personal Project + Kaggle

Here, I’m going to split my time between finishing up the course, personal project and the Kaggle competition. For the personal project, I need to make sure I don’t choose anything too complicated. It shouldn’t be a full-time, 2 month job and as a show piece it’s more about the end-to-end completion of a product/tool/investigation.

* * *

## Month 4 (+ 5)

### Update Your Resume

It’s time to work on the resume. The big trick here is to showcase transferable skills as well as the new skills and project work. Personally I think the pet project and Kaggle work will be the big ticket items to highlight.

This is also when I’ll start to review job descriptions. Do I feel confident that I have what employers are looking for? How can I update my resume to reflect those requirements?

### Portfolio

Along with blog articles, a portfolio of projects should be on display. In my case, I’ll go into details about the what and how of my personal project.

### Company Over Role

Here I’m looking for great companies I’d be happy to wake up and leave my house each morning for. Create a list of about 10 such companies.

Another smaller but import point, know your options. In my city, Toronto CA, you won’t find as many startups or midsize companies clamoring for ML engineers like NY or SF. So I’ll keep my eyes open for relocation possibilities as well.
