<!-- ![](about.jpg) -->

I’m Jason Carter, a freelance technical writer, data strategist and (sci-fi) book lover/reviewer. But I'm also a computer language polyglot and an ex-computer teacher to the elderly and new immigrants.

I’ve worked across a large number of industries from finance to travel and consumer electronics to entertainment media. And in each new industry I worked up and down the end-to-end customer journey from sales engineer to backend data engineer - breaking down complex technical jargon and schematics into easy to follow instructions, summaries, bullet points and flow charts.

Oh, and I believe in [failing fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast) as defined by wikipedia. In my personal and professional life, I want to be:

> A \[...\] system that is designed to halt as well as report the error on failure
>
> \[and be less\] likely to erroneously perform an irreversible or costly operation.
