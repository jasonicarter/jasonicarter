It’s not rocket science. It’s linear algebra.

**_(Update August, 2017)_** _I quit. I studied. I’m a Data Engineer._

_The title of “Data Engineer” is strange, just like all data science titles, as it’s very dependent on the company, its size, industry, etc. What’s more important is your role/job description._

_At_ [_Format.com_](http://format.com)_, I’ll be their first “official” Data Engineer and my role is all encompassing. I will be taking over all data related matters at the company. This includes, the data analytics infrastructure/pipeline (ETL/ELT, data integrity, analytics tools), creating a more self-serve reporting, data-driven company and applying machine and deep learning to enhance our insights and build out great new features for our customers._

_I still have a lot more deeplearning to learn but sitting in a classroom not applying knowledge just isn’t my thing. Don’t worry, I’ll keep you posted on my education journey and in the meantime, continue reading below…_

## What (I did) and How (I did it)

Instead of boring you with great details I’m going to send you to my original Medium post [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/my-3-month-deep-learning-career-pivot-af94cd8d6a31) and my follow up LinkedIn post [over here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-study-guide-becoming-deep-learning-non-expert-jason-carter).

> TLDR: I quit. I studied. Now I need a job.

And now that you’re up-to-speed on things let me tell you the rest. I didn’t completely follow my original study plan, it’s more of a 4 month journey now filled with extra studying was squeezed in. And since I’m pretty close to finishing this career-life project, I wanted to give my update.

Let me first share with you my “final” schedule and then I’ll discuss the changes and reasoning behind it, with a little beginner’s advice at the end.

> BTW: Subtitle— It’s not rocket science. It’s linear algebra. — implies in no way that Machine or Deep Learning is easy.

## My Schedule

At this point I’m now studying full-time, doing maybe 10–14 hours a day. I kept a work-like daily schedule, fitting in a gym and lunch break. Mostly the hours where during the weekday, sometimes going to sleep at 1 or 2AM, but I also had days where I got absolutely nothing done. Sometimes it was due to me just being lazy (summer is here!) other times it was due to burnout.

_As a reminder, my background going to this — education wise — I have a Software Engineering degree and a_ [_Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree_](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)_. Along with work experience as both a developer and analyst._

### Misc.

1.  Just as a note, each course or program has plenty of reading material — blog articles, Stanford University online CNN course, academic papers, etc — and as usual, you get out of it what you put in. I’ve done plenty of “extra” reading but certainly there are areas I skimmed over or had no personal interest in learning more about.
2.  I’m currently in month 4-ish (mid-July actually makes it 3.5, I’m ahead of schedule) but it wont be a full month of studying as I plan to start my job search soon.

## The Details

I made 3 major changes to my original schedule:

1.  [Data Scientist with Python](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python) (DataCamp)
2.  [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Coursera)
3.  Capstone Project (End-to-End Deep Learning Project)

I decided to take **Data Scientist with Python by DataCamp**, after initially starting Deep Learning Part 2. Thinking a bit on the practical side of things, current roles aren’t segmented into only deep learning vs. only “classical” machine learning. So although having hands-on practical deep learning experience is great, saying in an interview I don’t know the difference between the [kNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) and [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithms would be embarrassing.

Also, although the Fast AI program is taught in Python, it’s not teaching Python, while the DataCamp career track had a number of Python specific courses along with data mining and manipulation.

Given that I already completed Udacity’s Data Analyst course, I found the DataCamp program to be mostly a refresher (with some new tips and tricks) but that’s exactly what I needed.

A good summary would sound like:

*   _The DataCamp program is light on deep dives but broad on topics covered. You get hands-on Python coding every step of the way which is great!_
*   _The Udacity program gives a lot more details into each machine learning algorithm, how to use them and has excellent large scale projects._

**Machine Learning by Stanford University**, taught by Andrew Ng on Coursera is probably the most famous machine learning course on the internet. And that’s pretty much the main reason why I wanted to give it a try. Also, I heard from friends that it’s a great course.

My goal for taking this course was to practice some re-enforcement learning on myself. Although I had taken both Udacity and DataCamp courses by the time I started, both of which cover machine learning — from different angles, I thought learning from one of the best in the field definitely couldn’t hurt.

The course was quite interesting, entertaining and challenging. Like everything else, there were parts which I fully understood, while others I’m still not 100% clear on.

I don’t think [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) will be very useful to me in any new role but it wasn’t hard to pick up for the few assignments. And although the course was a great experience, I believe Udacity’s Data Analyst nanodegree has more practical usefulness.

The last thing to help round off my journey, I thought, would be a **Capstone End-to-End Deep Learning Project**. Data science or machine/deep learning isn’t just about theory, algorithms, research and publishing papers! For me, I’ve always wanted to build products, be an implementor, make things.

In my capstone project I will define a problem, potential solution, source data, build and test models, productionize the model, implement an API, UI front-end and deploy to “production”. In essence, I’m going to build an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, resulting in a live product

…Or at least, that’s the plan.

## My Advice to Beginners

Start learning. You have no good excuse not too. Even if it’s a career change.

Take a few math courses, but only a few.

> Side Note: As for as I can tell, practical machine and deep learning doesn’t involve calculating/coding std, derivatives, back-propagation, kNN, etc by hand or even in Python without libraries — although I’m sure some interviewers think otherwise (aka split this string without str.split() func because in production we don’t use libraries and this will show us how you’ll handle that business case.)

But I digress…it’s not to say you don’t need the math, and you certainly need to understand what terms mean, how to interpret them and how to fix models (or parameters) based on their information. But in the world of practical implementation of machine and deep learning, PhDs aren’t required:

> It’s not rocket science. It’s linear algebra.

But one big item, it’d suggest **NOT** to do, is to fill your time with studying. Do some actual hands-on work, practice with real data, you’ll need it for experience and for interviews but more importantly for real world problems once you start your new career.

I feel like I’ve stuffed my face full of machine & deep learning “stuff”, there’s always a new paper to read or an Medium article published. Pace yourself! I’m pretty sure I didn’t.

And if you’re wondering in which order would I recommend you take all of the above courses, here it is:

1.  Data Scientist with Python (DataCamp)
2.  Data Analyst Nanodegree (Udacity)
3.  Machine Learning by Andrew Ng (Coursera)
4.  Deep Learning (Fast AI)
5.  Work on Personal Projects or Kaggle (during steps 1–4)

P.S. I have a little “reading list” which I’ve been updating, trying to keep track of the more important things I’ve done during my study. You can read it on my blog: [http://jasonicarter.github.io/deep-learning-reading-list](http://jasonicarter.github.io/deep-learning-reading-list/)

## Next On My Schedule

Get a job. My final item will of course be getting back to work. I’ll try to do it as selectively as possible, not to say that I haven’t done it that way before, but I think given this is a career change it’ll be good to review every aspect of the process.

So far, I’ve been passively reviewing companies, investigating what exactly do they do in the machine and deep learning fields. Some roles “Machine Learning Engineer” do very little deep learning while others entitled “Data Engineer” ask for quite a bit of CNN or NLP knowledge along with things like Docker and Apache Spark.

Two things I’ve learnt (or is that learned?) so far are:

1.  There aren’t really any “Deep Learning Engineer” roles it’s just tied up in the ML descriptions so read the job responsibility section carefully.
2.  Data Scientist, Data Engineer and even Data Analyst roles can vary a lot by company and job responsibilities. This can probably be subset into enterprise vs startup company needs.

For me personally, based on my interests, I’ll be looking for a role that allows me to expand my expertise in deep learning (that in itself is a large field) while still working with some “classical” machine learning techniques. And if they threw in some UI dev work (proof of concept stuff) that’s even better…**Full-Stack ML Engineer** anyone???
